# SteamNamebyName

Here I am again. I made a small programm for finding out players hex id by their RP Names. 
For Example if players name is Yavuz SE. You have to write /getSteam Yavuz SE and it will give players identifier out to discord.
The Webhook is server-side so nobody can access it and you can add an ingame notifier or just a print. Posting it to discord makes
it alot easier to copy steamid.
